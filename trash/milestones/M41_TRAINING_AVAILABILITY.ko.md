# M41. Training availability conditions

## Objective

Port and recheck this milestone by original erAV transaction/capability units, not by gate pass or owner-name transfer.

Old strict closure status: blocked
New split-review status: pending-new-method-recheck
Old closure title: Training command availability and unavailable reasons

## Original Source Scope

Canonical source scope is the machine manifest, plus direct review of original ERB/CSV/VariableSize/Chara CSV before any new closure.

Use this split document as navigation only. Do not duplicate the full source-unit row list here; the manifest remains canonical.

## Submilestones

## Source Inventory Summary

- Total source units: 1631
- Implemented-verified under old rules: 4
- Approved-excluded under old rules:
- Blocked under old rules: 1626
- Open gaps under old gap audit: 0

Status counts from manifest:
- blocked: 1626
- implemented-verified: 4
- scope-redesign-required: 1

Source kind counts from manifest:
- feature: 1624
- csv-row: 3
- session-address: 3
- source-file-review: 1

Top source paths from manifest:
- original-game/ERB/指導関係/COMABLE.ERB: 1620
- original-game/CSV/Item.csv: 6
- original-game/ERB/指導関係/COMSEQ_REGISTER.ERB: 4
- original-game/ERB/指導関係/COMORDER.ERB: 1

## Transfer Contracts

Do not treat approved-excluded as completion. Every transfer must identify:

| sourceUnitId | source effect | from | to | receiver evidence | sender obligation | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | M41 | TODO | TODO | TODO | open |

## Required Omission Attacks

- Dynamic CALL/CALLFORM/TRYCALLFORM expansion checked.
- CSV role checked as runtime behavior, not passive data.
- Computed FLAG/CFLAG/TFLAG/GLOBAL addresses resolved to semantic aliases.
- Success, failure, cancel, repeat, and limit paths listed.
- ADDCHARA/DELCHARA/LOADGLOBAL/SAVEGLOBAL/BEGIN/RETURN primitive effects listed.
- mapped, source-file-review, and static profile rows challenged.
- Receiver laundering and self-exclusion challenged.
- Runtime trace required; runtimeConsumerId text alone is not trace.

## Worker Instructions For This Milestone

Use workers only for bounded evidence tasks:

- Worker A: attack original inventory completeness.
- Worker B: inspect dynamic calls, CSV roles, and state-family aliases.
- Worker C: verify transfers against receiver manifests.

Workers must return structured candidates, not completion decisions.

## Responsibility Notes From Old Closure

- no old closure responsibility notes available

## Do Not Count As Complete

- Gate pass alone.
- Closure count equality.
- mapped or source-file-review rows.
- Owner-name transfer without receiver evidence.
- UI route existence without original state effects.
- Smoke pass without source-level runtime trace.
